IMPORTANT: DO NOT work off Master, for every major change you make, make sure you
create a new branch with the following format. "NAME - Changes you've made."

Assigment-3-Code
- Every section will have one .c and .h file.

- To begin, write the functions that you will create in the .h file allocated to
you. This will tell me what you will be spending your time on.

- The .h files are for DECLARING the functions

- List out all of the functions you want to implement with a description of what
it will do so I know you're on the right track.
    - eg. int isValid () /* This checks if input is valid */

- The .c files are for DEFINING what the functions do
    - eg. int isValid () {
        if (int = 0) {
          return 1;
          }
    }
